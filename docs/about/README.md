# What is PHPCoin?

PHPCoin is a decentralized digital currency, also known as a cryptocurrency, built entirely in the PHP programming language. It is designed to be an accessible and educational platform for PHP developers to explore blockchain technology.

## Elapsed Proof of Work

PHPCoin uses a unique consensus algorithm called Elapsed Proof of Work (EPoW). Unlike traditional Proof of Work systems that rely on solving computationally intensive puzzles, EPoW's difficulty is determined by the time that has passed since the last block was found. This approach aims to create a more equitable mining environment, reducing the advantage of specialized hardware like ASICs.

## Smart Contracts

The PHPCoin blockchain supports smart contracts written directly in PHP. Developers can create and deploy contracts as standard PHP classes, leveraging their existing skills to build decentralized applications without needing to learn a new programming language. The platform provides a secure sandbox for execution and direct access to blockchain data.

## Apps and Dapps

PHPCoin features a built-in ecosystem for "apps" and decentralized applications ("dapps"). These are web-based applications that can be run directly from a PHPCoin node, providing a simple way to create user interfaces and services that interact with the blockchain and its smart contracts.
