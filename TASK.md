# Task Planning: Docs Improve

This file will be used to coordinate and plan the documentation improvement task.

## Instructions

- All further work will be on this branch.
- I will either chat with you, or I will update `TASK.md` and tell you to refresh, read, and act.

## How to Work

1. Always keep this task file updated.
2. Always commit early and commit often. Keep actions atomic, and always immediately commit and push changes. Never wait to push. Ex: do not wait for subagent review before pushing.
